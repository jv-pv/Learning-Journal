                <p>
                    I like to think of myself as a lifelong learner. I used to spend hours
                    and hours learning, then try to create simple projects using what I learned 
                    or work new techniques into existing projects.
                </p>
                <h3>
                    How I got started
                </h3>
                <p>
                    I started simple and gradually grew my learning journal site. I would take notes 
                    about what I was learning. After each learning session, I'd use my notes to not 
                    only reflect on what I learned but also write short summaries of what I learned using my own words.
